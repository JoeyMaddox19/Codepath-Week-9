# Codepath-Week-9

Honeypot Deployed: Dionaea over HTTP (the initial honeypot required in the lab) 
Issues: I am a little confused why I was the only one who actually attacked my honeypot. That's not an issue per se, but still something that I thought was a little weird. 
Summary: One attack from the United States (it was me from my friends machine)
Concerns: I am very confused why I was only attacked by myself. I know other students were attacked by thousands of bots. I followed all the instructions and was able to attack it, so I'm not sure why this happened.
